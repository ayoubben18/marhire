# Logo Upload Fix - Testing Guide

## Changes Made

### 1. **SocieteController.php Updates**
- ✅ Added `ImageProcessingService` dependency injection
- ✅ Replaced simple `move()` with robust `processImage()` method
- ✅ Added automatic directory creation and error handling
- ✅ Added timestamped filenames to avoid conflicts

### 2. **Template Updates**
- ✅ Standardized all logo references to use `config('logo')`
- ✅ Added cache-busting parameters with `?v=` + timestamp
- ✅ Fixed both frontend (`app.blade.php`) and admin (`dashboard_admin.blade.php`) layouts

### 3. **Production Assets**
- ✅ Compiled with `npm run production`

## How to Test

### 1. **Test Logo Upload in Production:**
1. Go to: `https://marhire.com/settings`
2. Upload a new logo image (JPG/PNG, max 2MB)
3. Should work without errors (previously failed)

### 2. **Test Logo Display:**
1. Check logo appears correctly across all pages
2. Logo should update immediately (no caching issues)
3. Both desktop and mobile versions should show new logo

### 3. **Compare with Listings:**
- Now both business logo and listing images use the same robust upload system
- Both should work identically in production

## What Was Fixed

**Before:**
- Simple `move()` method without directory creation
- Fixed filename caused conflicts
- No error handling for production server differences
- Inconsistent logo references caused caching issues

**After:**
- Robust `ImageProcessingService` with automatic directory creation
- Timestamped filenames prevent conflicts
- Smart path handling for both localhost and production
- Cache-busting prevents logo display issues
- Consistent with how listings handle images

## Key Improvements

1. **Automatic Directory Creation**: Creates `/public/images/` if missing
2. **Production Path Handling**: Works with both localhost and cPanel hosting
3. **Error Handling**: Provides clear error messages on upload failure
4. **Cache Busting**: Forces browsers to load new logo immediately
5. **Consistency**: Uses same upload system as listings (which worked correctly)
