const bookingFaqs = [
    { q: "What payment methods do you accept?", a: "We offer flexible payment options. You can pay securely online with most major credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, etc.). For many services, a 'Pay on Delivery' option is also available, allowing you to pay in cash when you meet your provider." },
    { q: "Are there any hidden fees?", a: "No. MarHire is committed to transparent pricing. The total price you see at checkout includes all mandatory fees and taxes. Any optional add-ons are clearly stated." },
    { q: "Do I need to pay a deposit for my booking?", a: "It depends. Many car rentals are available with a no-deposit option, which may include a small surcharge. For luxury vehicles or specific partners, a refundable security deposit may be required on your credit card at pickup. Check each listing for details." },
    { q: "How do I change or cancel my booking?", a: "Since we don't have user accounts yet, all changes and cancellations are handled by our support team. Please contact us via email or WhatsApp with your booking reference number." },
    { q: "When will I receive my refund after a cancellation?", a: "Once a refund is approved according to the booking's policy, we process it immediately. It typically takes 5-10 business days for the funds to appear back on your original payment method." },
    { q: "Do you offer discounts for longer rentals?", a: "Yes, many partners offer reduced daily rates for longer car rental periods (e.g., 7+ days). The discount is automatically calculated and reflected in the total price when you select your dates." },
    { q: "How do I get an invoice for my booking?", a: "You will receive a confirmation email that serves as a detailed receipt. If you require a formal invoice, please contact our support team with your booking reference." },
    { q: "Is it safe to pay online?", a: "Absolutely. Our payment processor is fully PCI-compliant and uses industry-standard encryption. We never store your full credit card details on our servers." },
];

const carFaqs = [
    { q: "What is included in my car rental?", a: "Standard rentals include basic insurance (CDW), third-party liability, and local taxes. The mileage policy (e.g., unlimited kilometers) often depends on the rental duration; always check the listing details." },
    { q: "What are the age and license requirements?", a: "The minimum age is usually 21, but can be 23 or 25 for certain cars. You must have held your valid driving license for at least one year. \nâž¤ **Tip:** We strongly recommend carrying an International Driving Permit (IDP) to avoid any issues." },
    { q: "Can I have the car delivered to my airport or hotel?", a: "Yes, airport and hotel delivery is a standard service. Many partners offer free delivery within their city limits. Any applicable fees are shown on the listing." },
    { q: "What is the fuel policy?", a: "Our standard policy is 'Same-to-Same.' You receive the car with a certain level of fuel and are expected to return it with the same amount to avoid extra charges." },
    { q: "Can I rent a car in one city and return it in another?", a: "Yes, one-way rentals between major Moroccan cities (e.g., Marrakech to Fes) are possible. This service may incur a one-way fee. Cross-border travel outside Morocco is not permitted." },
    { q: "What should I do in case of a breakdown or accident?", a: "First, ensure everyone is safe. For any accident, you must contact the police to get a report (*constat*), as it is required for insurance. Then, call the 24/7 roadside assistance number on your rental voucher." },
];

const driverFaqs = [
    { q: "How do airport transfers work?", a: "Your professional driver will monitor your flight and wait in the arrivals hall with a sign bearing your name. The price for your airport transfer is fixed, so you don't have to worry about traffic or extra costs." },
    { q: "Are the drivers multilingual?", a: "Yes, our private drivers are professionals who typically speak multiple languages, including French, Arabic, and English. Some also speak Spanish or German; check the driver's profile for details." },
    { q: "Can I book a driver for a city-to-city transfer?", a: "Absolutely. We offer comfortable intercity transfers, such as from Marrakech to Agadir or Casablanca to Rabat. It's a great way to travel between cities without the hassle of public transport." },
    { q: "What about luggage, child seats, and waiting time?", a: "Each vehicle has a specified luggage capacity. Child seats can be requested in advance. For airport transfers, a standard waiting time (usually 60 minutes) is included for free." },
    { q: "How do I change my pickup time or location?", a: "To make any changes to your private driver booking, please contact our support team via WhatsApp or email as soon as possible, and we will coordinate with the driver." },
    { q: "How do I pay for my private driver?", a: "Similar to our other services, you can book your private driver or airport transfer in Morocco by paying securely online or choosing a 'Pay in Cash' option where available." },
];

const boatActivityFaqs = [
    { q: "What's included in a boat rental or activity?", a: "This varies, but typically includes safety equipment, a guide/skipper, and necessary gear. For boat rentals, the fuel policy will be specified. Always check the 'What's Included' section on the listing page." },
    { q: "What happens if there's bad weather?", a: "Safety is our priority. If a boat trip or outdoor activity is cancelled by the provider due to bad weather, you will be offered the choice to either reschedule or receive a full refund." },
    { q: "Can I book a private boat trip or tour?", a: "Yes, many listings for boat rentals and activities in cities like Marrakech or Agadir are available as private experiences, allowing you to customize the itinerary with the provider." },
    { q: "Are there age limits or safety measures for children?", a: "Most activities are family-friendly, but some may have age or height restrictions for safety. Life jackets, including child sizes, are provided for all boat trips. Please check the listing details." },
    { q: "Is hotel pickup available for activities?", a: "Many tours and activities include complimentary pickup and drop-off from centrally located hotels. You can verify this on the listing page and provide your hotel details during checkout." },
    { q: "How do I cancel or change an activity booking?", a: "To cancel or modify your activity, please contact our support team. Be sure to check the cancellation policy on your booking confirmation, as cutoff times may vary." },
];

const policyFaqs = [
    { q: "What documents do I need at pickup?", a: `For car rentals, you'll need your driving license, passport/ID, and booking voucher. For all services, the lead booker should have an ID. An International Driving Permit (IDP) is highly recommended for driving.` },
    { q: "Who is responsible for traffic fines, tolls, and parking?", a: "The renter is fully responsible for all traffic fines, road tolls, and parking fees incurred. Unpaid fines will be charged by the rental agency, often with an administrative fee." },
    { q: "What are my insurance options?", a: "All car rentals include basic third-party liability and CDW with an excess (deductible). You can often upgrade to a 'full protection' package at the rental desk to reduce or eliminate this excess." },
    { q: "How is my personal data handled?", a: `We only collect data necessary to complete your booking. For full details, please read our <a href="${PRIVACY_URL}" class="underline font-medium text-primary">Privacy Policy</a>.` },
    { q: "Where can I find the full terms of service?", a: `All bookings are subject to our platform rules. You can review our complete <a href="${TERMS_URL}" class="underline font-medium text-primary">Terms & Conditions</a> for more information.` },
    { q: "What if I have a complaint or an issue with a provider?", a: "Your satisfaction is our priority. Please contact MarHire support immediately. We will act as a mediator to help resolve the situation with the local partner fairly and efficiently." },
];

const contactFaqs = [
    { q: "What is the best way to contact you?", a: `For urgent issues, the fastest way is via <a href="${WHATSAPP_URL}" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="underline font-medium text-primary">WhatsApp</a>. For general questions, changes, or cancellations, you can email us at ${CONTACT_EMAIL}.` },
    { q: "What are your support hours?", a: `Our support team is available ${SUPPORT_HOURS}.` },
    { q: "What is the difference between general and emergency support?", a: "General support handles bookings and questions during business hours. Emergency support (via the number on your voucher) is for immediate, on-the-road issues like breakdowns and is available 24/7." },
    { q: "How long does it take to get a response?", a: "We pride ourselves on fast responses. WhatsApp messages are typically answered within minutes, while emails are answered within a few hours during our support window." },
