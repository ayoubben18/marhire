# MarHire Booking System Enhancement PRD

## Intro Project Analysis and Context

### Existing Project Overview

#### Analysis Source
- Document-project output available at: docs/brownfield-architecture.md

#### Current Project State
MarHire is a Laravel 8 + React marketplace where booking functionality currently exists only in the admin dashboard. Clients cannot book services directly through the website. The backend BookingController and Booking model exist but lack client-facing endpoints.

### Enhancement Scope Definition

#### Enhancement Type
- ✓ New Feature Addition (client-side booking functionality)

#### Enhancement Description
Enable clients to book services directly through the website for all four categories (car rental, boat rental, private driver, activities) without requiring authentication or admin intervention.

#### Impact Assessment
- ✓ Moderate Impact (some existing code changes)
- New API endpoint implementation
- Frontend form integration with backend
- Email notification system activation

### Goals and Background Context

#### Goals
- Enable direct client bookings without authentication
- Support all four service categories with their specific requirements
- Send automatic booking confirmations to clients and providers
- Maintain compatibility with existing admin booking management
- Reduce operational overhead by 80% through self-service bookings

#### Background Context
Currently, all bookings must be manually entered by administrators, creating a 24-48 hour delay and limiting business hours to admin availability. The booking infrastructure exists but lacks the client-facing API endpoint and frontend integration. This enhancement will connect the existing UI forms to a new public API endpoint.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**FR1:** The system shall implement a public `/api/bookings/submit` endpoint that accepts booking requests without authentication

**FR2:** The booking API shall accept category-specific fields based on category_id (2=Car, 3=Driver, 4=Boat, 5=Activity)

**FR3:** The booking form components (BookingFrm, CarRentalForm, PrivateDriverForm, BoatForm, ThingsToDoForm) shall submit data to the booking API

**FR4:** The system shall validate all required fields and return HTTP 422 with field-specific errors for invalid data

**FR5:** The system shall calculate total price including base price and selected add-ons before submission

**FR6:** Upon successful booking, the system shall send confirmation emails to both the client and the service provider

**FR7:** The booking shall be saved with 'Pending' status and generate a unique confirmation number

**FR8:** The system shall prevent double-booking by checking availability before confirmation

**FR9:** The booking forms shall show loading states during submission and success/error messages after

**FR10:** The existing admin booking management interface shall display all client-submitted bookings

### Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1:** The booking API shall respond within 500ms under normal load conditions

**NFR2:** Email sending shall be queued to prevent blocking the booking submission

**NFR3:** The system shall handle concurrent booking requests without creating race conditions

**NFR4:** All booking data shall be validated on both frontend and backend

**NFR5:** Error messages shall be user-friendly and actionable

**NFR6:** The booking form shall remain functional if JavaScript fails to load (progressive enhancement)

### Compatibility Requirements

**CR1: Existing Admin API Compatibility**: All existing admin booking endpoints at /bookings/* must continue functioning

**CR2: Database Schema Compatibility**: Use existing bookings table schema without modifications

**CR3: UI/UX Consistency**: Booking forms must maintain existing Material UI component styling

**CR4: Integration Compatibility**: Use existing Laravel Mail configuration and queue system

## User Interface Enhancement Goals

### Integration with Existing UI

The booking enhancement will utilize the existing React components (BookingFrm, CarRentalForm, etc.) with minimal visual changes. The focus is on adding functionality to these existing forms by connecting them to the backend API. All Material UI and Tailwind CSS patterns will be maintained.

### Modified/New Screens and Views

- **Booking Forms** (existing components, adding API integration):
  - BookingFrm.jsx - General booking form
  - CarRentalForm.jsx - Car-specific fields
  - PrivateDriverForm.jsx - Driver service fields  
  - BoatForm.jsx - Boat rental fields
  - ThingsToDoForm.jsx - Activity booking fields

- **Booking Confirmation Modal** (new):
  - Success message with confirmation number
  - Booking summary
  - Next steps information

- **Form States** (enhance existing):
  - Loading state during submission
  - Success state with confirmation
  - Error state with field-specific messages

### UI Consistency Requirements

- Use existing Material UI components (TextField, Button, Select)
- Maintain current Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Follow existing color scheme and spacing
- Keep current form layout patterns
- Add loading spinners matching existing style
- Error messages in existing alert component style

## Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

### Existing Technology Stack

Extracted from document-project analysis:
- **Languages**: PHP 7.3+, JavaScript/TypeScript
- **Frameworks**: Laravel 8.75, React 18.3.1
- **Database**: MySQL/MariaDB
- **Infrastructure**: Traditional LAMP/LEMP stack
- **External Dependencies**: Laravel Passport, Material UI, Tailwind CSS

### Integration Approach

**Database Integration Strategy**: Use existing bookings table and related models without schema changes. All category-specific fields already exist in the database.

**API Integration Strategy**: Add new public endpoint to routes/api.php. Implement submitBooking method in existing BookingController. Use Laravel's built-in validation and response patterns.

**Frontend Integration Strategy**: Add axios calls to existing form components. Use React hooks for state management. Handle loading/error states with existing UI patterns.

**Testing Integration Strategy**: Add PHPUnit tests for new API endpoint. Add Jest tests for form submission logic. Manual testing checklist for each booking category.

### Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach**: No new directories needed. Add method to existing BookingController. Enhance existing React components in-place.

**Naming Conventions**: Follow existing camelCase for JavaScript, snake_case for PHP. API endpoint follows existing RESTful pattern.

**Coding Standards**: Laravel PSR-12 for PHP code. Existing ESLint configuration for React components.

**Documentation Standards**: PHPDoc blocks for new methods. JSDoc comments for enhanced React components. Update API documentation.

### Deployment and Operations

**Build Process Integration**: No changes to build process. Existing npm run production and composer commands.

**Deployment Strategy**: Standard Laravel deployment. No new environment variables. Database already configured.

**Monitoring and Logging**: Use existing Laravel logs for booking submissions. Queue monitoring for email jobs.

**Configuration Management**: No new config files needed. Use existing mail and queue configurations.

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

Referenced from document-project Technical Debt section:

**Technical Risks**: 
- Missing submitBooking method could have been intentionally removed
- Concurrent bookings might cause availability conflicts
- Email delivery failures could lose booking confirmations

**Integration Risks**:
- Frontend forms might have undocumented dependencies
- Category-specific validation rules might not match current business rules
- Existing admin dashboard might not handle client bookings properly

**Deployment Risks**:
- No rollback if emails start sending to wrong recipients
- Performance impact of public booking endpoint unknown

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Implement feature flag for gradual rollout
- Add comprehensive logging for all booking attempts
- Test with single category before enabling all
- Monitor queue performance during initial launch

## Epic and Story Structure

### Epic Approach

**Epic Structure Decision**: Single epic for booking functionality implementation. This is a focused enhancement that adds one cohesive feature - enabling clients to book services. All stories work together to deliver this single business capability.

## Epic 1: Enable Client-Side Booking Functionality

**Epic Goal**: Implement end-to-end booking functionality that allows clients to book services directly through the website without authentication, maintaining full compatibility with the existing admin system while reducing operational overhead.

**Integration Requirements**: All new code must integrate seamlessly with existing Laravel patterns, use current database schema without modifications, and maintain compatibility with admin dashboard booking management.

### Story 1.1: Implement Booking Submission API Endpoint

As a guest user,
I want to submit booking requests through a public API,
so that I can book services without creating an account.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. POST endpoint `/api/bookings/submit` is accessible without authentication
2. Endpoint accepts all booking fields defined in Booking model fillable array
3. Returns 201 Created with booking ID and confirmation number on success
4. Returns 422 Unprocessable Entity with field-specific validation errors
5. Handles all four category types with their specific validation rules

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Existing admin booking endpoints continue working unchanged
- IV2: New bookings appear in admin dashboard without modification
- IV3: Database transaction handling prevents partial bookings

### Story 1.2: Add Booking Validation Service Layer

As a system,
I want to validate booking data according to business rules,
so that only valid bookings are accepted.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Validate required fields based on category_id (2=Car, 3=Driver, 4=Boat, 5=Activity)
2. Check listing exists and is active before accepting booking
3. Validate dates are in the future and logical (pickup before dropoff)
4. Ensure selected add-ons belong to the chosen listing
5. Calculate and validate total price matches sum of base price and add-ons

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Validation rules match those used in admin panel
- IV2: Existing BookingRequest validation class is extended, not replaced
- IV3: All error messages follow Laravel's validation message format

### Story 1.3: Implement Booking Confirmation Emails

As a client and service provider,
I want to receive email confirmations when bookings are made,
so that I have a record of the reservation.

5. Failed email attempts are logged but don't block booking creation

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Uses existing mail configuration from .env
- IV2: Follows same email template structure as ContactMail
- IV3: Queue jobs visible in existing queue monitoring

### Story 1.4: Connect Frontend Booking Forms to API

As a user,
I want the booking forms to submit my information,
so that I can complete my reservation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. BookingFrm component submits to `/api/bookings/submit` on form submission
2. Show loading spinner (existing style) during API call
3. Display success message with confirmation number in modal
4. Show field-specific validation errors below each input
5. Clear form data after successful submission

**Integration Verification:**

## Next Steps

### UX Expert Prompt

Review the MarHire booking system PRD (docs/prd.md) and create UI/UX specifications for the booking flow. Focus on the existing form components that need API integration and the new confirmation modal. The goal is functional connection, not visual redesign. Use existing Material UI and Tailwind patterns.

### Architect Prompt

Review the MarHire booking system PRD (docs/prd.md) and brownfield architecture document (docs/brownfield-architecture.md) to create a technical architecture for implementing client-side booking functionality. Focus on adding the missing submitBooking API endpoint and connecting existing React forms to the backend while maintaining all current system patterns.
