# User Interface Enhancement Goals

### Integration with Existing UI

The booking enhancement will utilize the existing React components (BookingFrm, CarRentalForm, etc.) with minimal visual changes. The focus is on adding functionality to these existing forms by connecting them to the backend API. All Material UI and Tailwind CSS patterns will be maintained.

### Modified/New Screens and Views

- **Booking Forms** (existing components, adding API integration):
  - BookingFrm.jsx - General booking form
  - CarRentalForm.jsx - Car-specific fields
  - PrivateDriverForm.jsx - Driver service fields  
  - BoatForm.jsx - Boat rental fields
  - ThingsToDoForm.jsx - Activity booking fields

- **Booking Confirmation Modal** (new):
  - Success message with confirmation number
  - Booking summary
  - Next steps information

- **Form States** (enhance existing):
  - Loading state during submission
  - Success state with confirmation
  - Error state with field-specific messages

### UI Consistency Requirements

- Use existing Material UI components (TextField, Button, Select)
- Maintain current Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Follow existing color scheme and spacing
- Keep current form layout patterns
- Add loading spinners matching existing style
- Error messages in existing alert component style
