# Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

### Existing Technology Stack

Extracted from document-project analysis:
- **Languages**: PHP 7.3+, JavaScript/TypeScript
- **Frameworks**: Laravel 8.75, React 18.3.1
- **Database**: MySQL/MariaDB
- **Infrastructure**: Traditional LAMP/LEMP stack
- **External Dependencies**: Laravel Passport, Material UI, Tailwind CSS

### Integration Approach

**Database Integration Strategy**: Use existing bookings table and related models without schema changes. All category-specific fields already exist in the database.

**API Integration Strategy**: Add new public endpoint to routes/api.php. Implement submitBooking method in existing BookingController. Use Laravel's built-in validation and response patterns.

**Frontend Integration Strategy**: Add axios calls to existing form components. Use React hooks for state management. Handle loading/error states with existing UI patterns.

**Testing Integration Strategy**: Add PHPUnit tests for new API endpoint. Add Jest tests for form submission logic. Manual testing checklist for each booking category.

### Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach**: No new directories needed. Add method to existing BookingController. Enhance existing React components in-place.

**Naming Conventions**: Follow existing camelCase for JavaScript, snake_case for PHP. API endpoint follows existing RESTful pattern.

**Coding Standards**: Laravel PSR-12 for PHP code. Existing ESLint configuration for React components.

**Documentation Standards**: PHPDoc blocks for new methods. JSDoc comments for enhanced React components. Update API documentation.

### Deployment and Operations

**Build Process Integration**: No changes to build process. Existing npm run production and composer commands.

**Deployment Strategy**: Standard Laravel deployment. No new environment variables. Database already configured.

**Monitoring and Logging**: Use existing Laravel logs for booking submissions. Queue monitoring for email jobs.

**Configuration Management**: No new config files needed. Use existing mail and queue configurations.

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

Referenced from document-project Technical Debt section:

**Technical Risks**: 
- Missing submitBooking method could have been intentionally removed
- Concurrent bookings might cause availability conflicts
- Email delivery failures could lose booking confirmations

**Integration Risks**:
- Frontend forms might have undocumented dependencies
- Category-specific validation rules might not match current business rules
- Existing admin dashboard might not handle client bookings properly

**Deployment Risks**:
- No rollback if emails start sending to wrong recipients
- Performance impact of public booking endpoint unknown

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Implement feature flag for gradual rollout
- Add comprehensive logging for all booking attempts
- Test with single category before enabling all
- Monitor queue performance during initial launch
