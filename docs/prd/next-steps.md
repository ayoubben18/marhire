# Next Steps

### UX Expert Prompt

Review the MarHire booking system PRD (docs/prd.md) and create UI/UX specifications for the booking flow. Focus on the existing form components that need API integration and the new confirmation modal. The goal is functional connection, not visual redesign. Use existing Material UI and Tailwind patterns.

### Architect Prompt

Review the MarHire booking system PRD (docs/prd.md) and brownfield architecture document (docs/brownfield-architecture.md) to create a technical architecture for implementing client-side booking functionality. Focus on adding the missing submitBooking API endpoint and connecting existing React forms to the backend while maintaining all current system patterns.
