| -------------------------------- | ------- | --------------- |
| 1. Problem Definition & Context  | PASS    | None |
| 2. MVP Scope Definition          | PASS    | None |
| 3. User Experience Requirements  | PASS    | None |
| 4. Functional Requirements       | PASS    | None |
| 5. Non-Functional Requirements   | PARTIAL | Missing detailed security, monitoring specs |
| 6. Epic & Story Structure        | PASS    | None |
| 7. Technical Guidance            | PASS    | None |
| 8. Cross-Functional Requirements | PARTIAL | Missing data migration, monitoring details |
| 9. Clarity & Communication       | PASS    | None |

### Top Issues by Priority

**BLOCKERS**: None - PRD is ready for architect

**HIGH**:
- Security requirements need more detail (authentication for future phases)
- Monitoring and alerting approach not specified

**MEDIUM**:
- No user research data cited (assumptions based on business logic)
- Data migration approach for existing bookings not addressed

**LOW**:
- Future enhancement roadmap could be clearer
- Deployment frequency not explicitly stated

### MVP Scope Assessment
The scope is appropriately minimal:
- ✅ Single feature focus (booking functionality)
- ✅ No authentication complexity
- ✅ Reuses existing infrastructure
- ✅ Can be delivered in 1-2 sprints

### Technical Readiness
- **Clarity**: Technical constraints are well-defined
- **Risks**: Concurrent booking conflicts identified and mitigated
- **Architecture Ready**: Yes, existing patterns to follow
