# Intro Project Analysis and Context

### Existing Project Overview

#### Analysis Source
- Document-project output available at: docs/brownfield-architecture.md

#### Current Project State
MarHire is a Laravel 8 + React marketplace where booking functionality currently exists only in the admin dashboard. Clients cannot book services directly through the website. The backend BookingController and Booking model exist but lack client-facing endpoints.

### Enhancement Scope Definition

#### Enhancement Type
- ✓ New Feature Addition (client-side booking functionality)

#### Enhancement Description
Enable clients to book services directly through the website for all four categories (car rental, boat rental, private driver, activities) without requiring authentication or admin intervention.

#### Impact Assessment
- ✓ Moderate Impact (some existing code changes)
- New API endpoint implementation
- Frontend form integration with backend
- Email notification system activation

### Goals and Background Context

#### Goals
- Enable direct client bookings without authentication
- Support all four service categories with their specific requirements
- Send automatic booking confirmations to clients and providers
- Maintain compatibility with existing admin booking management
- Reduce operational overhead by 80% through self-service bookings

#### Background Context
Currently, all bookings must be manually entered by administrators, creating a 24-48 hour delay and limiting business hours to admin availability. The booking infrastructure exists but lacks the client-facing API endpoint and frontend integration. This enhancement will connect the existing UI forms to a new public API endpoint.
