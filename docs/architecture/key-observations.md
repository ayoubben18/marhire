# Key Observations

1. **Booking System Status**: The booking system exists but is completely disconnected from the frontend. The API endpoint exists but the controller method is missing.

2. **No Client-Facing Booking**: All booking functionality is currently admin-only through the dashboard.

3. **i18n Not Implemented**: The project has no internationalization infrastructure despite being a tourism platform.

4. **Component Organization**: Good component structure but lacks proper state management and API integration.

5. **Database**: Booking model supports all categories but needs client-facing implementation.
