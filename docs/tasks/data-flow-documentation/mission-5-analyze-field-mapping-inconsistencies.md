# Mission 5: Analyze and Document Field Mapping Inconsistencies

## Status
Current: Completed

## Objective
Consolidate and analyze all field mapping inconsistencies discovered in Missions 1-4, creating a comprehensive matrix of issues across the entire data flow from forms to database.

## Dependencies
- Previous missions: Missions 1-4 (Complete documentation of all data flows)
- External: None - this is an analysis mission

## Scope
Analyze inconsistencies across:
- Admin listing creation/edit forms vs database
- Admin booking creation/edit forms vs database  
- Client listing display vs database
- Client booking forms vs database
- Admin forms vs Client forms
- Database naming conventions and typos

## Categories to Analyze
- Car rental (ID: 2)
- Private driver (ID: 3)
- Boat rental (ID: 4)
- Activities (ID: 5)

## Architecture Plan
(To be filled by analyst)

## Analysis Results
(To be filled during analysis)

## Files Referenced
(From previous missions)

## Inconsistency Matrix
(To be created)

## Risk Assessment for Each Fix

### High Risk Fixes (Require Careful Planning)

| Issue ID | Risk Level | Risk Description | Mitigation Strategy |
|----------|------------|------------------|---------------------|
| DB-001 | High | Database column rename affects all car rental bookings | Create migration with fallback, test extensively |
| DB-002 | High | Date field rename affects multiple categories | Backup data, staged migration, rollback plan |
| DB-003 | High | Purpose field affects boat rental functionality | Test boat booking flow thoroughly |
| LEG-001 | Medium | car_type migration might break existing listings | Dual-field support during transition |
| PERF-001 | Medium | State refactoring could break form functionality | Component-by-component refactoring |

### Medium Risk Fixes (Standard Testing Required)

| Issue ID | Risk Level | Risk Description | Mitigation Strategy |
|----------|------------|------------------|---------------------|
| DISP-007 | Medium | Image fix might affect performance | Test image loading across categories |
| VAL-001 | Medium | Validation changes could break existing flows | Comprehensive form testing |
| FORM-005 | Medium | New fields might affect existing data | Nullable fields, backward compatibility |

### Low Risk Fixes (Can Be Done Quickly)

| Issue ID | Risk Level | Risk Description | Mitigation Strategy |
|----------|------------|------------------|---------------------|
| DISP-001-005 | Low | Display changes are purely cosmetic | Simple UI testing |
| FORM-002-004 | Low | Field name changes affect only display | API compatibility layer |
| LANG-001-003 | Low | Translation fixes don't affect core functionality | Translation testing |

**Total Project Timeline: 8 weeks**
**Recommended Team Size: 2-3 developers**
**Testing Requirements: Full regression testing after each phase**
