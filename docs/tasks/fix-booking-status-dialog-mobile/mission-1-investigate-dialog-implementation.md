# Mission 1: Investigate and Document Current Dialog Implementation

## Status
Current: Completed

## Objective
Investigate the current booking status dialog implementation in the admin dashboard, document how it works, and identify the specific responsive issues causing problems on mobile devices.

## Dependencies
- Previous missions: None (first mission)
- External: React components, admin dashboard code

## Architecture Plan
Focus exclusively on the **Status Change Modal** - jQuery/Bootstrap-based modal in bookings/list.blade.php.
This modal lacks proper mobile responsive design, causing usability issues on small screens where:
- Booking ID is not visible
- Save button is not clickable/accessible

## Investigation Findings

### Current Implementation
**Status Change Modal Location**: `resources/views/bookings/list.blade.php` (lines 129-172)
- Uses standard Bootstrap modal without responsive classes
- Triggered by `.change-status` button with jQuery
- Contains booking ID field (#id_u) - disabled input field
- Status dropdown using select2
- Save button at bottom of modal

### Modal Structure:
```html
<div class="modal fade" id="editModal">
  <div class="modal-dialog">  <!-- No responsive size classes -->
    <div class="modal-content">
      <!-- Modal body with form elements -->
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Responsive Issues Identified (Status Change Modal Only):
- Modal uses fixed width that doesn't adapt to mobile screens
- Modal may be partially off-screen on small devices
- Form elements not properly stacked for mobile
- Save button may be below the viewport fold
- No scrolling mechanism if content exceeds viewport height
- Touch targets may be too small for mobile interaction

## Implementation
### Files Requiring Changes:
**`resources/views/bookings/list.blade.php`** (lines 129-172)
- Add responsive modal size classes (modal-sm for mobile)
- Improve form element stacking
- Add custom CSS media queries for mobile
- Ensure modal is scrollable on small screens
- Make sure booking ID is always visible
- Ensure save button is accessible

## Testing
- Test on various screen sizes
- Document specific breakpoints where issues occur
- Capture screenshots of the problem

## Notes
- Focus on understanding current implementation before proposing fixes
- Document all findings for next missions
