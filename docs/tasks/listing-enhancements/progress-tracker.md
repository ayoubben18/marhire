# Task: Listing Category Enhancements

## Task Status

Current: In dev

## Problem Statement

Enhance the listing management system across four categories (Car Rental, Boat Rental, Things to Do, Private Driver) with specific field modifications, image handling improvements, and UI/UX refinements. Also update the Listing List view to remove unnecessary fields.

## Context & Constraints

-   Working with existing Laravel + React booking platform
-   Database contains production data - must preserve data integrity
-   Four listing categories need different enhancements
-   Image processing needs to be automated (WebP conversion)
-   Must maintain backwards compatibility with existing bookings
-   Follow existing codebase patterns and conventions
-   Use existing services and infrastructure (no external services)

## Expected Outcome

-   Car Rental: Multi-select car types, image size display, WebP conversion
-   Boat Rental: 30-minute duration intervals, multiple duration selection, updated marina locations, optional deposit fields
-   Things to Do: Simplified fields, image improvements
-   Private Driver: Smart location defaults, city filtering based on pricing, streamlined fields
-   Listing List: Cleaner interface with relevant fields only
-   All categories: Automatic WebP image conversion with size guidelines
