# Mission 3: Frontend Layout Restructure

## Status

Current: COMPLETED ✅

## Objective

Restructure the listing page layout to follow modern booking platform standards with proper visual hierarchy, category-specific specifications, and consistent styling using MarHire's existing color palette.

## Dependencies

-   Previous missions:
    -   Mission 1: Navbar fix (COMPLETED - navbar no longer overlaps)
    -   Mission 2: Gallery implementation (COMPLETED - Viator-style gallery working)
-   External:
    -   Existing React components and patterns
    -   Tailwind CSS utility classes
    -   MUI components where appropriate
    -   i18n translation system

## Architecture Plan

(To be filled by architect agent)

### Component Architecture Strategy

Based on MarHire's frontend patterns:

-   **Hybrid Blade-React mounting**: Components mount to specific DOM elements
-   **Component organization**: Site components in `resources/js/components/site/`
-   **State management**: Local component state with React hooks
-   **Styling approach**: Tailwind CSS primary, MUI for complex forms, existing custom classes
-   **i18n integration**: Use `useTranslation()` hook for all text

### Layout Structure to Implement

1. Breadcrumbs
2. Title (H1)
3. Location + Provider Logo
4. Gallery (already completed)
5. Specifications with Icons (category-specific)
6. Trust Notes (Free cancellation, Best price, Local expertise)
7. Overview (Short description)
8. Booking Terms with Icons
9. Terms & Conditions / Cancellation Policy / Insurance
10. Special Notes
11. What's Included/Not Included
12. Meeting Point (Things to Do only)
13. Dealer Note
14. Full Description
15. Related Listings Comparison
16. Sticky Booking Form (right side)

### Category-Specific Specifications

Need to dynamically render based on listing.category_id:

**Things to Do (category_id: 4)**

-   Activity Type
-   Pickup Included
-   Private or Group
-   Group Size
-   Difficulty Level

**Boat Rental (category_id: 3)**

-   Boat Type
-   Captain
-   Capacity
-   Departure Location

**Private Driver (category_id: 2)**

-   Vehicle Type
-   Vehicle Model

-   Max Luggage
-   Languages

**Car Rental (category_id: 1)**

-   Fuel Type
-   Transmission
-   Number of Seats
-   Number of Doors
-   A/C
-   Mileage Policy
-   Fuel Policy
-   Driver Age Requirement

### Styling Guidelines

-   **DO NOT hardcode colors** - use existing Tailwind classes and CSS variables
-   Extract colors from existing components and app.css
-   Maintain responsive design with mobile breakpoints
-   Use existing icon libraries (React Icons, Lucide React, MUI Icons)

## Implementation

✅ COMPLETED - Layout restructured successfully

### Key Changes Made:

1. **Reordered sections** in `/resources/js/pages/Listing.jsx` to follow exact specification:
   - Gallery (4) → Specifications (5) → Trust Badges (6) → Overview (7) → Booking Terms (8) → etc.

2. **Fixed category mapping** in `EnhancedListingSpecs.jsx`:
   - Car Rental: category_id 1
   - Private Driver: category_id 2  
   - Boat Rental: category_id 3
   - Things to Do: category_id 4

3. **Updated field validation** in CarRentalSpecs.jsx:
   - Uses `number_of_seats` and falls back to `seats`
   - Uses `number_of_doors` and falls back to `doors`  
   - Uses `air_conditioning` and falls back to existing variants
   - Uses `deposit` as primary field

4. **Maintained existing functionality**:
   - All gallery components preserved from Mission 2
   - Booking form logic unchanged
   - i18n translations intact
   - Responsive design maintained

### Architecture Decisions:

- **Component reuse**: Used existing layout components where possible
- **Field validation**: Added fallbacks for field name variations
- **No hardcoded colors**: Maintained existing Tailwind classes
- **Preserved state**: Kept all booking form state and search params

### Build Status:
✅ `npm run dev` completed successfully
