# Mission 1: Fix Navbar Overlapping

## Status
Current: Completed

## Objective
Fix the navbar overlapping issue where the sticky navbar was covering the content below it, making breadcrumbs and title invisible.

## Problem Description
The navbar has a `sticky` class with `position: sticky` but the content below (breadcrumbs, title, etc.) was positioned directly under it without proper spacing, causing the navbar to overlap the content.

## Solution Implemented
Added `paddingTop: '80px'` to the main `bt-page listing-details` container to create proper spacing between the sticky navbar and the content.

## Files Modified
- `/resources/js/pages/Listing.jsx` - Added padding-top to main container

### Change Details
```jsx
// Before
<div className="bt-page listing-details">

// After  
<div className="bt-page listing-details" style={{ paddingTop: '80px' }}>
```

## Testing
✅ Build completed successfully
✅ Navbar no longer overlaps content
✅ Breadcrumbs and title are now visible
✅ Content flows properly below navbar

## Visual Confirmation
- Before: Breadcrumbs and title were hidden under navbar
- After: Proper spacing with 80px padding ensures all content is visible

## Notes
- The navbar uses `position: sticky` with `top: 0` which keeps it at the top when scrolling
- 80px padding accounts for the navbar height plus some breathing room
- This fix maintains responsive behavior on mobile devices
