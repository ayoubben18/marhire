# Story 3.4: React Frontend i18n Implementation

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** website visitor,
**I want** the frontend interface to display in my preferred language,
**so that** I can navigate and understand the platform in French or Spanish.

## Context

The React frontend needs internationalization support to display UI text, labels, and messages in the user's selected language. This story implements react-i18next for frontend translations.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Install and configure react-i18next**:
   - npm install react-i18next i18next i18next-http-backend i18next-browser-languagedetector
   - Create i18n.js configuration file
   - Set up language detection from URL
   - Configure fallback language

2. **Create translation JSON files**:
   - public/locales/en/translation.json
   - public/locales/fr/translation.json
   - public/locales/es/translation.json
   - Organize by component/feature namespaces

3. **Create LanguageContext** in resources/js/contexts/:
   - Current language state
   - Language change handler
   - Available languages list
   - Persist language preference

4. **Implement LanguageSwitcher component**:
   - Dropdown with flag icons
   - Display current language
   - Change language on selection
   - Update URL to include locale prefix
   - Smooth transition between languages

5. **Update main App.js**:
   - Wrap with I18nextProvider
   - Initialize i18n configuration
   - Load translations dynamically
   - Handle language routing

6. **Convert hardcoded strings** in key components:
   - Navigation menu items
   - Search form labels and placeholders
   - Category names
   - Button texts
   - Form validation messages
   - Use useTranslation hook

7. **Handle dynamic content from API**:
   - Pass locale in API requests
   - Display translated content from backend
   - Fall back to English if translation missing

8. **Add language-specific formatting**:
   - Date formatting per locale
   - Number formatting (currency, decimals)
   - Use i18next formatting functions

## Technical Requirements

- React 18.x compatibility
- react-i18next latest version
- Lazy loading of translation files
- TypeScript support (if applicable)

## Dependencies

- Story 3.1 (Laravel i18n infrastructure)
- Story 3.2 (Database translations)

## Estimated Effort

- Frontend setup: 8 hours
- Component updates: 12 hours
- Translation files: 4 hours
- Testing: 4 hours
- Total: 28 hours

## Testing Requirements

1. Unit tests for LanguageContext
2. Component tests with translations
3. E2E tests for language switching
4. Translation key coverage tests

## Definition of Done

- [x] react-i18next configured
- [x] Translation files created
- [x] LanguageSwitcher component working
- [x] Main components translated
- [x] Dynamic content displaying correctly
- [x] Language persistence working
- [x] All tests passing
- [x] No hardcoded strings remaining
