## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

-   BookingClientConfirmation and BookingProviderNotification already exist
-   Both implement ShouldQueue for async processing
-   Email templates exist but need enhancement
-   Current implementation handles missing provider emails

### Data Models

**New Fields to Include in Emails**:

-   Client: fullName, dateOfBirth, countryOfResidence, whatsAppNumber, termsAccepted, flightNumber
-   Category-specific: All fields based on category type
-   Booking: additionalNotes field for special requests

### API Specifications

**WhatsApp Business API** (if integration proceeds):

-   Official API: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/business-api
-   Alternative: Twilio WhatsApp API
-   Message format: Booking confirmation with key details
-   Requires: Business verification, API credentials

### File Locations

-   Update: `app/Mail/BookingClientConfirmation.php`
-   Update: `app/Mail/BookingProviderNotification.php`
-   Update: `resources/views/emails/booking-client.blade.php`
-   Update: `resources/views/emails/booking-provider.blade.php`
-   Create: `app/Services/WhatsAppNotificationService.php` (if API available)

### Technical Constraints

-   Maintain backward compatibility with existing emails
-   WhatsApp integration is optional (don't break if unavailable)

-   Keep emails queued for performance
