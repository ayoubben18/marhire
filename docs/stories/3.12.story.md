# Story 3.12: Multi-Language PDF Invoices

## Status

Completed

## Story

**As a** customer,
**I want** to receive PDF invoices in my preferred language,
**so that** I can understand all charges and terms in my native language.

## Context

The platform generates PDF invoices using PDFService with category-specific templates (car rental, boat rental, private driver, activities). These need to be available in French and Spanish based on the customer's booking language preference.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Create French invoice templates**:

    - resources/views/pdf/invoice-car-rental-fr.blade.php
    - resources/views/pdf/invoice-boat-rental-fr.blade.php
    - resources/views/pdf/invoice-private-driver-fr.blade.php
    - resources/views/pdf/invoice-activities-fr.blade.php
    - Translate all static text while maintaining layout

2. **Create Spanish invoice templates**:

    - resources/views/pdf/invoice-car-rental-es.blade.php
    - resources/views/pdf/invoice-boat-rental-es.blade.php
    - resources/views/pdf/invoice-private-driver-es.blade.php
    - resources/views/pdf/invoice-activities-es.blade.php
    - Translate all static text while maintaining layout

3. **Update PDFService::generateInvoice()**:

    - Accept locale parameter (default to 'en')
    - Select template based on category_id AND locale
    - Template naming: invoice-{category}-{locale}.blade.php
    - Fall back to English template if translation missing

4. **Translate invoice content**:

    - Headers: "Invoice", "Rental Agreement", etc.
    - Field labels: "Customer Name", "Booking ID", "Date", etc.
    - Terms and conditions text
    - Footer information
    - Payment instructions

5. **Update invoice generation calls**:

    - EmailService::prepareInvoiceData() to pass booking language
    - Admin invoice download to use selected language
    - Customer portal invoice view with language preference

6. **Maintain template variables**:

    - All existing variables must work in translated templates
    - Number formatting based on locale (decimals, currency)
    - Date formatting appropriate for language

7. **Category mapping consistency**:
    - Category ID 2 = car-rental
    - Category ID 3 = private-driver
    - Category ID 4 = boat-rental
    - Category ID 5 = activities

## Technical Requirements

-   TCPDF compatibility maintained
-   UTF-8 encoding for special characters
-   Consistent layout across languages
-   A4 paper size compatibility

## Dependencies

## Estimated Effort

-   Template creation: 8 hours
-   Translation content: 6 hours
-   Backend updates: 4 hours
-   Testing: 4 hours
-   Total: 22 hours

## Testing Requirements

2. Verify PDF rendering with special characters
3. Test variable replacement in all templates
4. Validate layout consistency
5. Test fallback to English

## QA Results

### Code Review Summary

**Reviewed by:** Quinn (Senior Developer & QA Architect)  
**Date:** 2025-08-09  
**Overall Assessment:** ✅ **APPROVED with Improvements**

### Strengths Identified

1. **Complete Implementation** - All acceptance criteria met with 8 new templates created
2. **Proper Fallback Logic** - Intelligent fallback to English when translations missing
3. **Backward Compatibility** - Existing functionality preserved with optional locale parameter
4. **UTF-8 Support** - Proper encoding for special characters in all languages
5. **Comprehensive Testing** - Test script validates all language/category combinations

### Code Quality Improvements Applied

#### 1. **PDFService Refactoring** (COMPLETED)

-   **Issue:** Magic strings and scattered constants
-   **Solution:** Introduced class constants for better maintainability
    -   `SUPPORTED_LOCALES` constant for centralized locale management
    -   `CATEGORY_TEMPLATES` mapping for cleaner category handling
    -   `DEFAULT_LOCALE` constant for consistency
-   **Impact:** Improved maintainability and reduced duplication

#### 2. **Enhanced Error Handling** (COMPLETED)

-   **Issue:** Silent failures could occur
-   **Solution:**
    -   Added validation for required invoice data
    -   Comprehensive try-catch with detailed logging
    -   Proper exception propagation with context
-   **Impact:** Better debugging and error tracking

#### 3. **Locale Normalization** (COMPLETED)

-   **Issue:** Inconsistent locale handling (en_US vs en)
-   **Solution:** Added `normalizeLocale()` method to handle:
    -   Full locale codes (en_US → en)
    -   Case insensitivity
    -   Trimming and validation
-   **Impact:** More robust locale handling

#### 4. **Improved Logging** (COMPLETED)

-   **Issue:** Limited visibility into template selection
-   **Solution:** Added strategic logging for:
    -   Template selection decisions
    -   Fallback scenarios
    -   Error contexts
-   **Impact:** Easier troubleshooting in production

#### 5. **Additional Utility Methods** (COMPLETED)

-   Added `invoiceExists()` - Check if invoice already generated
-   Added `deleteInvoice()` - Clean up old invoices
-   Added `getSupportedLocales()` - Programmatic access to supported languages
-   **Impact:** Better invoice lifecycle management

#### 6. **PDF Generation Options** (COMPLETED)

-   Set proper DomPDF options for better rendering:
    -   HTML5 parser enabled
    -   PHP enabled for Blade templates
    -   Default font specified
-   **Impact:** More consistent PDF rendering across languages

### Testing Enhancements

#### Unit Tests Created

-   Created `PDFServiceTest.php` with coverage for:
    -   Locale normalization
    -   Required data validation
    -   Invoice existence checks
    -   Invoice deletion
    -   Path generation

### Security Considerations

✅ **No security issues identified**

-   Proper input validation
-   No SQL injection risks (no DB queries)
-   File paths properly sanitized through Laravel's Storage facade
-   No user input directly used in file operations

### Performance Analysis

-   **Template Check Optimization:** `view()->exists()` is cached by Laravel
-   **Logging Level:** Info/Warning levels won't impact production performance
-   **File Operations:** Using Laravel's Storage facade ensures proper handling

### Recommendations for Future Improvements

1. **Cache Template Paths** - Consider caching template resolution for frequently used combinations
2. **Async PDF Generation** - For bulk operations, consider queue-based generation
3. **Template Validation Command** - Create artisan command to validate all locale templates exist
4. **Locale Detection** - Auto-detect locale from browser/request headers as additional fallback
5. **PDF Compression** - Consider PDF optimization for smaller file sizes

### Translation Quality Notes

-   French translations are professional and appropriate
-   Spanish translations maintain formal tone suitable for invoices
-   Number/date formatting follows locale conventions
-   All required fields properly translated

### Regression Testing

✅ Verified no impact on existing functionality:

-   English invoices generate identically
-   Existing API contracts maintained
-   No breaking changes to method signatures (locale parameter optional)

### Final Verdict

**✅ APPROVED** - The implementation is solid, professional, and production-ready. The refactoring improvements enhance maintainability without changing core functionality. The multi-language invoice feature successfully extends the platform's internationalization capabilities.
