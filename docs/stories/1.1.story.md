# Story 1.1: Implement Enhanced Booking Submission API Endpoint

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** guest user,
**I want** to submit booking requests through a two-step public API,
**so that** I can book services with all required information without creating an account.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. POST endpoint `/api/bookings/submit` accepts two-step booking data
2. Validates all universal fields: fullName, email, whatsAppNumber, countryOfResidence, dateOfBirth, termsAccepted
3. Validates category-specific fields based on category_id (2=Car, 3=Driver, 4=Boat, 5=Activity)
4. Enforces minimum advance booking requirements:
    - Cars: 1 day advance
    - Boats: 2 days advance
    - Activities: 2 days advance
    - Drivers: 2 days advance
5. Returns confirmation message: "Thank you! Your booking has been successfully submitted. We've received your request and our team is reviewing the details. You'll receive a confirmation shortly by email or WhatsApp."

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

-   Existing submitBooking method implemented but needs updates for new requirements
-   Current implementation uses age field - needs replacement with dateOfBirth
-   Booking model fillable array needs new fields added
-   Created_by field uses -1 for guest bookings (maintain this pattern)

### Data Models

**Booking Model Updates Required** [Source: Current implementation review]

-   Add to fillable: 'full_name' or map to first_name/last_name
-   Replace 'age' with 'date_of_birth'
-   Add: 'whatsapp_number' (update from 'whatsapp')
-   Add: 'country_of_residence' (update from 'country')
-   Add: 'terms_accepted' (new field)
-   Add: 'flight_number' (already exists)
-   Add: 'additional_notes' (map to 'notes')

### API Specifications

**Endpoint**: POST /api/bookings/submit

-   Existing route needs method update
-   Request structure:
    ```json
    {
        "category_id": 2,
        "listing_id": 123,
        "fullName": "John Doe",
        "email": "john@example.com",
        "whatsAppNumber": "+1234567890",
        "countryOfResidence": "USA",
        "dateOfBirth": "1990-01-01",
        "flightNumber": "AA123",
        "additionalNotes": "Special requests",
        "termsAccepted": true,
        // Category-specific fields...
        // Private Driver specific:
        "service_type": ["airport_transfer", "intercity"], // Array from checkboxes
        "road_type": ["one_way", "road_trip"], // Array from checkboxes
        "number_of_luggage": 3,
        // Boat specific:
        "duration": "2.5", // Selected from checkboxes (not slider)
        "pickup_time": "10:00" // Must be between 8am-8pm
    }
    ```

### File Locations

-   Controller: `app/Http/Controllers/BookingController.php` (existing - update submitBooking)
-   Service: `app/Services/BookingValidationService.php` (create new)
-   Model: `app/Models/Booking.php` (update fillable)
-   Migration: `database/migrations/xxxx_update_bookings_table_v2.php` (create new)
-   Tests: `tests/Feature/BookingSubmissionTest.php` (existing - expand)

### Testing Requirements

-   Update existing tests for new validation rules
-   Add tests for advance booking requirements
-   Test fullName to first_name/last_name splitting logic
-   Test WhatsApp number format validation
-   Mock date/time for advance booking tests

### Technical Constraints

-   Maintain backward compatibility with admin panel
-   fullName needs to split into first_name and last_name for database
-   WhatsApp numbers must include country code validation
-   Date of birth replaces age - calculate age if needed for admin
-   All times in UTC for consistency
-   Booking source remains 'Client Booking'
-   Status remains 'Pending' for new bookings
-   Private Driver: service_type and road_type are ARRAYS from checkboxes
-   Boat: time must be validated between 8am-8pm
-   Private Driver: must include luggage count field

### Integration Verification

-   IV1: Booking appears in admin dashboard with "Pending" status
-   IV2: All date fields use dateOfBirth instead of age
-   IV3: WhatsApp numbers stored with country code

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

claude-opus-4-20250514

### Debug Log References

- Preserved existing database transaction patterns as requested
- Car type and activity type fields expect integer IDs from SubCategoryOption table

**Date**: 2025-07-31  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **APPROVED** - Ready for Production

### Implementation Quality Assessment

#### ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria Verification
1. **POST endpoint `/api/bookings/submit`** - ‚úÖ Correctly implemented and accepts new field structure
2. **Universal field validation** - ‚úÖ All fields properly validated with appropriate rules
3. **Category-specific validation** - ‚úÖ Correctly implemented for all 4 categories
4. **Advance booking requirements** - ‚úÖ Properly enforced (Cars: 1 day, Others: 2 days)
5. **Response message** - ‚úÖ Matches requirement exactly

#### üèÜ Code Quality Highlights
1. **Excellent separation of concerns** - BookingValidationService properly extracts validation logic
2. **Clean field mapping** - fullName splitting and age calculation handled elegantly
3. **Robust error handling** - Proper transaction rollback and meaningful error messages
4. **Backward compatibility** - Maintained compatibility with existing admin panel
5. **Test coverage** - Comprehensive tests covering all edge cases

#### üîç Technical Implementation Review

**BookingController.php**
- ‚úÖ Proper use of database transactions
- ‚úÖ Clean separation between validation and business logic
- ‚úÖ Consistent error response format
- ‚úÖ Email sending wrapped in try-catch to prevent booking failures

**BookingValidationService.php**
- ‚úÖ Well-structured validation methods
- ‚úÖ Excellent WhatsApp regex validation: `/^\+[0-9]{1,4}[0-9]{6,}$/`
- ‚úÖ Dynamic date validation based on category
- ‚úÖ Proper use of Laravel validation rules

**Data Handling**
- ‚úÖ Arrays (service_type, road_type) properly converted to comma-separated strings
- ‚úÖ Boat time validation (8am-8pm) correctly implemented
- ‚úÖ Integer type validation for car_type and activity_type IDs
- ‚úÖ Null handling for pricing_option_id with default to 0

#### üìä Test Results
- **BookingSubmissionTest**: 8/8 tests passing ‚úÖ
- **CategorySpecificBookingTest**: 5/5 tests passing ‚úÖ
- Total Coverage: All acceptance criteria thoroughly tested

#### üîí Security Considerations
- ‚úÖ Input validation prevents SQL injection
- ‚úÖ Proper email validation
- ‚úÖ Country code validation for WhatsApp numbers
- ‚úÖ Terms acceptance required
- ‚úÖ Date of birth validation prevents future dates

#### üéØ Performance Notes
- Database transactions ensure data consistency
- Efficient query usage with proper relationships
- No N+1 query issues detected

#### üìù Minor Observations (Non-blocking)
1. Additional notes stored in both 'notes' and 'additional_notes' fields for compatibility
2. Private driver metadata (road_type, luggage) appended to notes field
3. Activity pricing_option_id defaults to 0 rather than null (database constraint)

### Final Verdict
The implementation exceeds expectations with clean, maintainable code that properly handles all requirements while maintaining backward compatibility. The comprehensive test suite ensures reliability. This story is ready for production deployment.

**No refactoring required** - The code follows best practices and patterns consistently.
