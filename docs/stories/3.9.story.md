# Story 3.9: [UNNECESSARY - SKIP]

## Status

SKIP - Not Required

## Story

**As an** admin user,
**I want** a centralized dashboard to manage all translations,
**so that** I can monitor translation coverage, quality, and update content across languages efficiently.

## Reason to Skip

This adds unnecessary complexity. The existing "Generate Translations" button in the admin listing form (Story 3.3) is sufficient for managing translations. No need for dashboards, metrics, or bulk operations.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Create TranslationController** with dashboard view:
   - Route: /admin/translations
   - Overview of translation coverage by content type
   - Language completion percentages
   - Recent translation activity log

2. **Build translation overview dashboard**:
   - Total listings: X (Y% translated to FR, Z% to ES)
   - Static pages translation status
   - Email templates translation status
   - Missing translations highlighted in red
   - Outdated translations in yellow (modified after translation)

3. **Implement bulk translation features**:
   - Select multiple listings for translation
   - "Translate All Untranslated" button
   - Queue system for bulk operations
   - Progress bar for batch translations
   - Email notification when complete

4. **Create translation quality metrics**:
   - Track which translations are auto vs manual
   - Last translation date for each item
   - Flag listings modified after translation
   - Translation word count statistics
   - Gemini API usage tracking

5. **Add translation search and filter**:
   - Search translations by keyword
   - Filter by language
   - Filter by translation status (complete/partial/missing)
   - Filter by content type (listing/email/static)
   - Sort by last modified date

6. **Implement translation editor interface**:
   - Side-by-side editor (original vs translation)
   - Rich text editing for descriptions
   - Character count indicators
   - Save draft functionality
   - Preview in context button

7. **Create translation workflow**:
   - Mark translations for review
   - Approval workflow for manual edits
   - Translation history/versioning
   - Revert to previous translation
   - Comments on translations

8. **Add export/import functionality**:
   - Export translations to CSV/Excel
   - Bulk import from spreadsheet
   - Validation on import
   - Import history log
   - Rollback failed imports

## Technical Requirements

- DataTables for sortable/filterable lists
- AJAX for inline editing
- Queue jobs for bulk operations
- Redis caching for dashboard metrics

## Dependencies

- Story 3.2 (Database translations)
- Story 3.3 (Gemini translation service)

## Estimated Effort

- Backend: 12 hours
- Frontend UI: 12 hours
- Testing: 4 hours
- Total: 28 hours

## Testing Requirements

1. Test dashboard metric calculations
2. Verify bulk translation queuing
3. Test import/export functionality
4. Validate translation editing
5. Performance test with large datasets
