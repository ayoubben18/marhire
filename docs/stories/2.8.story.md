# Story 2.8: Fix Email Sending on Booking Creation (Pending Status)

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** system administrator,
**I want** emails to be automatically sent when a new booking is created with "Pending" status,
**so that** customers receive immediate confirmation that their booking request has been received.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. When a new booking is created via submitBooking with status "Pending", automatically send booking_received email
2. Email templates use correct variables from database (invoice_no or 'N/A', check_in_date, check_out_date)
3. Email variables correctly map booking fields to template placeholders
4. Both customer and admin receive the pending booking notification
5. Email sending uses the new credentials from .env (no-reply@testdev.info)
6. Email logs are created with proper status tracking
7. PDF invoice is generated and attached for confirmed bookings only
8. Invoice number shows 'N/A' for pending bookings, actual invoice_no for confirmed bookings

## Dev Notes

### Current Issues Found:

1. **Missing 'name' field**: EmailService expects `$booking->name` but Booking has `first_name` and `last_name`
2. **Date field mismatch**: Templates expect `check_in_date` and `check_out_date` but Booking doesn't have these fields
3. **Category-specific dates**: Different categories use different date fields:
   - Category 2 (Car Rental): `pickup_date`, `dropoff_date`
   - Category 3,4,5: `prefered_date`
   - Horse Ride Tour (Category TBD): `prefered_date` or specific fields
4. **Invoice Number**: Use existing `invoice_no` field or show 'N/A' for pending bookings
5. **PDF Attachment**: Email mentions "invoice attached" - need to handle PDF generation
6. **Total Field**: Verify if database uses `total_price` or `total_amount`

### Implementation Approach:

1. **Add accessor to Booking model**:
```php
public function getNameAttribute()
{
    return trim($this->first_name . ' ' . $this->last_name);
}

public function getReferenceAttribute()
{
    // Use existing invoice_no if available, otherwise 'N/A' for pending bookings
    return $this->invoice_no ?: 'N/A';
}

public function getCheckInAttribute()
{
    if ($this->category_id == 2) {
        return $this->pickup_date;
    }
    return $this->prefered_date;
}

public function getCheckOutAttribute()
{
    if ($this->category_id == 2) {
        return $this->dropoff_date;
    }
    // For other categories, check_out is same as check_in
    return $this->prefered_date;
}
```

2. **Update EmailService::replaceVariables()**:
```php
protected function replaceVariables($text, $booking)
{
    // Handle date formatting properly
    $checkInDate = $booking->check_in;
    $checkOutDate = $booking->check_out;
    
    // Format dates if they exist
    if ($checkInDate && !is_string($checkInDate)) {
        $checkInDate = \Carbon\Carbon::parse($checkInDate)->format('M d, Y');
    }
    if ($checkOutDate && !is_string($checkOutDate)) {
        $checkOutDate = \Carbon\Carbon::parse($checkOutDate)->format('M d, Y');
    }
    
    $replacements = [
        '{{client_name}}' => $booking->name,
        '{{client_email}}' => $booking->email,
        '{{booking_reference}}' => $booking->reference, // Will be invoice_no or 'N/A'
        '{{invoice_no}}' => $booking->invoice_no ?: 'N/A',
        '{{booking_id}}' => $booking->id,
        '{{listing_title}}' => $booking->listing->title ?? 'N/A',
        '{{service}}' => $booking->listing->title ?? 'N/A',
        '{{total_amount}}' => '€ ' . number_format($booking->total_price ?? 0, 2),
        '{{total}}' => '€ ' . number_format($booking->total_price ?? 0, 2),
        '{{currency}}' => '€',
        '{{admin_email}}' => EmailSetting::getAdminEmail(),
        '{{check_in_date}}' => $checkInDate ?: 'N/A',
        '{{check_out_date}}' => $checkOutDate ?: 'N/A',
    ];
    
    return str_replace(array_keys($replacements), array_values($replacements), $text);
}
```

3. **Clean up BookingController::submitBooking()**:
```php
// Remove the duplicate sendBookingEmails call
// Keep only the EmailService calls that check settings
```

### File Locations

- Update: `app/Models/Booking.php` - Add accessors
- Update: `app/Services/Email/EmailService.php` - Fix variable replacements
- Update: `app/Http/Controllers/BookingController.php` - Remove duplicate email sending

### Testing Requirements

- Create a test booking for each category (including Horse Ride Tour)
- Verify email is sent with correct data
- Check email logs table for proper recording
- Test with actual SMTP credentials
- Verify PDF attachment for confirmed bookings
- Ensure invoice_no shows 'N/A' for pending status
- Test with missing optional fields

### Technical Constraints

- Must maintain backward compatibility
- Use existing EmailService interface
- Don't break existing email flows

### Integration Verification

- IV1: Emails sent on booking creation with status "Pending"
- IV2: Email contains correct booking information for each category
- IV3: Email logs properly track sending status

   - Thread-safe generation using database transactions
   - Automatic generation on booking creation via model boot method

2. **Clean Architecture**: 
   - Proper use of accessors in Booking model
   - Good separation between presentation and data logic
   - Removed code duplication (sendBookingEmails)

3. **Production Readiness**:
   - Migration handles existing data properly
   - Invoice numbers are permanent and searchable
   - Month-based counter system for organized numbering

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring needed - the implementation is solid and follows best practices.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Follows Laravel conventions properly
