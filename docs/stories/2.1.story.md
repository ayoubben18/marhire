# Story 2.1: Email Infrastructure Setup

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** system administrator,
**I want** to configure a simple email sending infrastructure,
**so that** the MarHire platform can send transactional emails to customers and administrators.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Laravel Mail is configured for direct SMTP sending (no queue)
2. SMTP settings are configurable via environment variables (.env)
3. Default sender email is set to `noreply@marhire.com` (configurable)
4. Default admin email is set to `admin@marhire.com` (configurable)
5. All email sends are logged in `email_logs` table with status tracking
6. Basic email templates are created for booking notifications

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Configure Laravel Mail (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4)
  - [x] Subtask 1.1: Update config/mail.php for SMTP configuration
  - [x] Subtask 1.2: Add mail environment variables to .env.example
  - [x] Subtask 1.3: Add admin email configuration
- [x] Task 2: Create Email Logging System (AC: 5)
  - [x] Subtask 2.1: Create email_logs migration with proper indexes
  - [x] Subtask 2.2: Create EmailLog model with relationships
  - [x] Subtask 2.3: Create EmailLogRepository for data access
- [x] Task 3: Implement Simple Email Service (AC: 1, 5, 6)
  - [x] Subtask 3.1: Create EmailService class with direct send method
  - [x] Subtask 3.2: Create SimpleBookingEmail mailable class
  - [x] Subtask 3.3: Create basic email templates
- [x] Task 4: Create Testing and Monitoring Tools
  - [x] Subtask 4.1: Create email monitoring command
  - [x] Subtask 4.2: Create email deliverability test command
  - [x] Subtask 4.3: Create unit tests for EmailService

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

- MarHire currently uses basic mail() function - needs complete overhaul
- No existing queue infrastructure - will need to set up from scratch
- Database uses MySQL - ensure email_logs table is optimized for high volume

### Data Models

**EmailLog Model** [Source: Email system requirements]
```php
Schema::create('email_logs', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->id();
    $table->unsignedBigInteger('booking_id');
    $table->string('recipient_email');
    $table->string('recipient_type', 20); // 'customer' or 'admin'
    $table->string('email_type', 50); // 'booking_received', 'booking_confirmed', etc
    $table->enum('status', ['queued', 'sent', 'failed'])->default('queued');
    $table->text('error_message')->nullable();
    $table->string('pdf_path', 500)->nullable();
    $table->json('email_data')->nullable(); // Store email content for debugging
    $table->integer('retry_count')->default(0);
    $table->timestamp('sent_at')->nullable();
    $table->timestamps();
    
    $table->foreign('booking_id')->references('id')->on('bookings');
    $table->index(['status', 'created_at']);
    $table->index(['booking_id', 'email_type']);
    $table->index('recipient_email');
});
```

### API Specifications

**Environment Variables Required**:
```env
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=noreply@marhire.com
MAIL_FROM_NAME="MarHire Booking System"
MAIL_ADMIN_ADDRESS=admin@marhire.com
```

**EmailService Interface**:
```php
interface EmailServiceInterface {
    public function send(string $recipient, string $emailType, Booking $booking, ?string $pdfPath = null): bool;
    public function sendBulk(array $recipients, string $emailType, Booking $booking): bool;
    public function getFailedEmails(int $days = 7): Collection;
    public function resend(int $emailLogId): bool;
}
```

### File Locations

- Config: `config/mail.php` (modify existing)
- Service: `app/Services/Email/EmailService.php` (create new)
- Repository: `app/Repositories/EmailLogRepository.php` (create new)
- Model: `app/Models/EmailLog.php` (create new)
- Migration: `database/migrations/2025_08_05_create_email_logs_table.php` (create new)
- Mailable: `app/Mail/SimpleBookingEmail.php` (create new)
- Commands: `app/Console/Commands/TestEmailDelivery.php`, `app/Console/Commands/MonitorEmailQueue.php` (create new)
- Templates: `resources/views/emails/booking/simple.blade.php` (create new)

### Testing Requirements

- Use Gmail SMTP or Mailtrap for testing
- Test direct email sending functionality
- Verify email logs are created correctly with proper status tracking
- Test email template rendering
- Manual testing with email:test command

### Technical Constraints

- Email sends are synchronous (no queue)
- Maximum email size: 25MB (including attachments)
- All times stored in UTC
- Email logs retained for audit trail

### Integration Verification

- IV1: Email sends immediately upon request
- IV2: Email log status updates correctly (sending → sent/failed)
- IV3: Failed emails can be manually retried using resend method
- IV4: Email templates render correctly with booking data

## QA Results

### QA Review by Quinn - Senior Developer & QA Architect
**Review Date:** 2025-08-05
**Review Status:** ✅ APPROVED with observations

#### Implementation Verification
✅ **All Acceptance Criteria Met:**
1. ✅ Laravel Mail configured for direct SMTP sending (verified in EmailService.php)
2. ✅ SMTP settings configurable via .env (confirmed in config/mail.php and .env.example)
3. ✅ Default sender email configurable as `noreply@marhire.com`
4. ✅ Default admin email configurable as `admin@marhire.com`
5. ✅ Email logs tracked in `email_logs` table with proper status tracking
6. ✅ Basic email templates created for booking notifications

#### Code Quality Assessment
**Architecture:** ✅ Clean separation of concerns with Service/Repository pattern
- EmailService implements EmailServiceInterface properly
- EmailLogRepository handles data persistence cleanly
- SimpleBookingEmail mailable provides good fallback mechanism

**Testing Infrastructure:** ✅ Well-designed
- TestEmailDelivery command allows manual testing
- MonitorEmailQueue command provides operational visibility
- Unit tests present for EmailService

**Database Design:** ✅ Optimized for scale
- Proper indexes on email_logs table (status, booking_id, recipient_email)
- Foreign key constraints properly set
- Status enum prevents invalid states

#### Compatibility with Story 2.2
✅ **Excellent Forward Compatibility:**

1. **Template System Ready:** Story 2.1's SimpleBookingEmail class is designed as a fallback, perfect for Story 2.2's database templates
2. **Service Layer Prepared:** EmailService's send() method signature accepts all necessary parameters for variable replacement
3. **Email Types Defined:** The email_type field in email_logs aligns with Story 2.2's template types
4. **No Breaking Changes Required:** Story 2.2 can extend Story 2.1 without modifying existing infrastructure

#### Transition Recommendations for Story 2.2
1. **Preserve SimpleBookingEmail:** Keep it as the fallback mechanism (already planned in 2.2)
2. **Extend EmailService:** Add template fetching logic without breaking existing direct send functionality
3. **Migration Compatibility:** email_logs table ready to track both direct and templated emails
4. **Variable System:** Current booking data structure provides all variables needed for 2.2

#### Minor Observations (Non-blocking)
1. Consider adding retry_at timestamp for future queue implementation
2. Email data JSON field could benefit from validation rules
3. Consider adding template_id to email_logs for future tracking

#### Security & Performance
✅ No SQL injection vulnerabilities detected
✅ Proper input sanitization in EmailService
✅ Indexes optimized for common query patterns
✅ No exposed credentials in code

#### Test Coverage Recommendations
- Add integration test for full email flow
- Test email delivery failure scenarios
- Verify retry mechanism behavior

### Final Verdict
**Story 2.1 is APPROVED for production.** The implementation is solid, well-architected, and provides an excellent foundation for Story 2.2. The transition between stories will be smooth with no breaking changes required. The team can confidently proceed to Story 2.2 implementation.
