# Story 1.2: Implement Category-Specific Validation Service

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** system,
**I want** to validate bookings according to category-specific business rules,
**so that** only valid bookings meeting all requirements are accepted.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Car Rental Validation**:
    - Minimum 3 days booking duration
    - Validate pickup/dropoff locations from allowed cities
    - Check SUV/MPV for surf rack eligibility
    - Duration calculation: every 24h = 1 day (even 1 minute over adds a day)
2. **Private Driver Validation**:
    - Validate service type array from checkboxes (can include both Airport Transfer AND Intercity)
    - Validate road type array from checkboxes (can include both One Way AND Road Trip)
    - Ensure pricing exists for selected route combination
    - Validate passenger count (required)
    - Validate luggage count (required)
3. **Boat Rental Validation**:
    - Time slots between 8am-8pm only
    - Duration from 30min to 8h in 30-minute increments
    - Validate number of people against boat capacity
    - Check captain requirement
4. **Things to Do Validation**:
    - Time preference: Morning/Afternoon/Evening/Night
    - For private: unlimited people
    - For group: validate against group size limit
    - Validate selected duration option exists

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

-   BookingValidationService created in Story 1.1 implementation
-   Basic category validation exists but needs enhancement
-   Current validation handles common fields and basic category checks
-   Need to expand with specific business rules per category

### Data Models

**Listing Model Relationships** [Source: Previous implementation]

-   hasMany addons through ListingAddonAffected
-   hasMany pricings through PrivateListingPricing
-   Contains capacity, requirements, and type information

**New Fields to Validate**:

-   Car: vehicle_type (for surf rack), city validation
-   Driver: service_type, road_type, route pricing
-   Boat: time slots, duration options, captain flag
-   Activity: time_preference, group_size, duration_options

### API Specifications

**Validation Rules by Category**:

```php
// Car Rental (Category 2)
'pickup_date' => 'required|date|after:today',
'dropoff_date' => 'required|date|after:pickup_date|min_days:3',
'pickup_location' => 'required|exists:cities,id',
'dropoff_location' => 'required|exists:cities,id',
'surf_rack' => 'required_if:vehicle_type,SUV,MPV',

// Private Driver (Category 3)
'service_type' => 'required|array|min:1',
'service_type.*' => 'in:airport_transfer,intercity',
'road_type' => 'required|array|min:1',
'road_type.*' => 'in:one_way,road_trip',
'city_a_id' => 'required|exists:cities,id',
'city_b_id' => 'required_if:service_type.*,intercity',
'number_of_passengers' => 'required|integer|min:1|max:listing_capacity',
'number_of_luggage' => 'required|integer|min:0',

// Boat Rental (Category 4)
'pickup_time' => 'required|date_format:H:i|between:08:00,20:00',
'duration' => 'required|in:0.5,1,1.5,2,2.5,3,3.5,4,4.5,5,5.5,6,6.5,7,7.5,8',
'number_of_people' => 'required|integer|min:1|max:boat_capacity',

// Things to Do (Category 5)
'time_preference' => 'required|in:morning,afternoon,evening,night',
'duration_option_id' => 'required|exists:listing_duration_options,id',
'number_of_people' => 'required|integer|min:1|max_if:type,group,group_size',
```

### File Locations

-   Service: `app/Services/BookingValidationService.php` (existing - enhance)
-   Models: Check for City, ListingDurationOption models
-   Pricing: `app/Models/PrivateListingPricing.php` for driver routes
-   Tests: `tests/Feature/BookingValidationTest.php` (existing - expand)

### Testing Requirements

-   Mock date/time for advance booking tests
-   Test duration calculations with edge cases
-   Validate time slot restrictions
-   Test capacity limits per listing type
-   Verify pricing existence for routes

### Technical Constraints

-   Maintain backward compatibility with existing validation
-   All validation errors must be field-specific
-   Time validations in UTC
-   Duration stored in hours (0.5 = 30min)
-   Category IDs remain hardcoded (2,3,4,5)

### Integration Verification

-   IV1: All validation errors return field-specific messages
-   IV2: Advance booking rules enforced at submission time
-   IV3: Category-specific fields only validated when applicable
